<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hello user! I am Soumya Pattarkine, a web developer student.This is my first ever web page designed with the help of html(html 5).<br/>
I am dedicated to continuous learning and growth, and i am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead.
</p>

<p>The webpage is designed to showcase my professional portfolio.
Through this project, I aimed to apply my skills in HTML.
I am eager to continue building upon this foundation. I invite you to explore the webpage and provide any feedback or suggestions 
you may have, as I am continuously looking to improve and evolve both the site and my expertise.
I would greatly appreciate any feedback or comments you may have, and I am eager to hear your thoughts on the content and design.
Thank you for your support and interest.</p>
